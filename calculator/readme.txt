	 * The Arithmetic Calculator application performs four basic arithmetic operations:
	 * addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. 
	 * 
	 * The application takes and validates inputs from users. In particular, users choose
	 * an operation from a given menu and provide two input numbers for the selected 
	 * operator. The application then validates users' inputs. If users' inputs are invalid, 
	 * users will be asked for re-entering their inputs. Otherwise, the application will 
	 * display the out put of selected operator in double data type.
